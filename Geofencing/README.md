# Geofencing Script - README

## Overview

This script, written in R, demonstrates geofencing capabilities using spatial data manipulation. Geofencing involves defining virtual boundaries based on geographical criteria, enabling location-based actions and analyses. In this script, we use the `sf` and `tidyverse` packages in R to perform geofencing tasks, such as loading spatial data, extracting coordinates, creating sample locations, and generating node IDs.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure that you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```R
# install packages
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load package

library(sf)
library(tidyverse)

```
